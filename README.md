## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this extension, other than Panic's Nova code editor for macOS. The extension does not require a local installation of Tailwind, therefore, it will also function when using Tailwind via CDN.

## Usage

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova.

## Configuration

### Workspace Configuration
The extension defaults to the latest version of Tailwind CSS with definitions. However, an older version of Tailwind CSS can be selected for the current workspace in the extension preferences.
